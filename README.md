# R-Code-to-nucommit----Freelon-et-al.-2018.-Quantifing-Social-Media-Power
Advanced library to implement a Data Processing Pipeline to quantify Social Media Power, as described by Freelon et al. (2018). Uses the nucommit library by chainsawriot. 


Scripts will need to be cleaned and updated for full functionality. Original implementation used Twitter API v01. This is depreceated now. 
I added another script to pull data from reddit and add to the analysis - if deemed useful. Original implementation of the algorithm is described in Freelon et al 2018. Quantifying Social Media Power. https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816676
