# R-Code-to-nucommit----Freelon-et-al.-2018.-Quantifing-Social-Media-Power
Advanced library to implement a Data Processing Pipeline to quantify Social Media Power, as described by Freelon et al. (2018). Uses the nucommit library by chainsawriot. 


Written in early 2021. The original implementation used Twitter API v01. This is depreceated now. Scripts will need to be cleaned and updated for full functionality.  
Original implementation of the algorithm is described in Freelon et al 2018. Quantifying Social Media Power. https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816676
For additional data collection, the library also contains a script to pull data from reddit and add to the analysis - if deemed useful.
